/** Proper handling of Null Pointer Exceptions
 * Null Pointer Exceptions are very common in Java.
 * This exception occurs in a result of an attempt to call a method on a Null Object Reference.
 * Null pointer exceptions are inevitable but for its better handling, there are some java coding best practices to follow.
 * First, it is important to check Nulls prior execution so that they can be eliminated and alter your code to handle it well.
 These can be:
 - Invoking a method from a null object.
 - Accessing or modifying a null objectâ€™s field.
 - Taking the length of null, as if it were an array.
 - Accessing or modifying the slots of null object, as if it were an array.
 - Throwing null, as if it were a Throwable value.
 - When you try to synchronize over a null object.
