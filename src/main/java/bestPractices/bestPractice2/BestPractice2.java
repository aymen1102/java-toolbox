/** Using enhanced for loops instead of for loops with counter
 * Generally, it wonâ€™t make any difference to use either of them but in some cases, the counter variable used could be very error-prone.
 * The counter variable can incidentally get altered, it may get used later in the code or you may start the index from 1 instead of 0
 * which will result in disturbing the code at multiple points. To eliminate this, enhanced for loop is a good option. */
