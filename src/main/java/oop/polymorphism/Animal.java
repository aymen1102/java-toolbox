package oop.polymorphism;

/**
 * Polymorphism means "many forms", and it occurs when we have many classes that are related
 * to each other by inheritance.
 * Inheritance lets us inherit attributes and methods from another class.
 * Polymorphism uses those methods to perform different tasks.
 * This allows us to perform a single action in different ways
 * For example, think of a superclass called Animal that has a method called animalSound().
 * Subclasses of Animals could be Pigs, Cats, Dogs, Birds -
 * And they also have their own implementation of an animal sound:
 * Why And When To Use "Inheritance" and "Polymorphism"?
 * It is useful for code reusability: reuse attributes and methods of an existing class
 * when you create a new class.
